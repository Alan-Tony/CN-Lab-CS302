0. sudo mn (Start network sim will default minimal topology
A. On mininet
1. help : command list
2. nodes: the hsots, switches, controllers
3. dump: more detaisl on network emulation settings
4. net: network links between devices
5. To issue commands to the host
	a. From mininet host:
		h1 command (eg h1 ping h2)
	b. xterm h1 (opens shell for h1)
		eg: i. h1 ping <ip for h2>
		    ii. tcpdump -n (-n for no name resolution): Do h1 pig h2 on another prompt, tcmpdump will caputre packets
6. ping all: pings from every host to every other hosts
7. iperf : tcp bacndwidth
8. iperfudp : udp bandwidth

9. On ending, clear up zombie processes and cache : sudo mn -c
10. introduce latency while launching network :
	sudo mn --link tc,bw=10,delay=10ms
	Test by using iperf
11. sudo wireshark & (To start wireshark, & to run as background process)
	a. of : filter for OpenFlow packets
	b. ping all (To get more 'of' packets
12. Other topologies:
	a. sudo mn --topo=single,4	(4 hosts)
	b. sudo mn --topo=linear,4	(switch for every host)
	c. sudo mn --top0=tree,2,2	(tree with 2 levels, 2 fan-out)
